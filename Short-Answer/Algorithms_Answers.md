#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) since it would be in linear time depending on n.

b) the answer would O(n log n) since the second loop is faster than the first loop.

c) This would be O(n) since it would scale based on n.

## Exercise II

I would drop an egg from midpoint and then if it didn't break I would drop again from the midpoint of the last dropzone to building height. Vice versa if it did break. Then I would keep repeating until it didn't break.
